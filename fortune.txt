Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.

A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.

A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.

Adapting old programs to fit new machines usually means adapting new machines to behave like old ones.

The best book on programming for the layman is Alice in Wonderland, but that's because it's the best book on anything for the layman.

%
Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.

%
To understand a program, you must become both the machine and the program.

It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.

As a rule, software systems do not work well until they have been used, and have failed repeatedly, in real applications.
-- Dave Parnas
%
The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
The effort of using machines to mimic the human mind has always struck me as rather silly. I would rather use them to mimic something better.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Perfecting oneself is as much unlearning as it is learning.

Much of the excitement we get out of our work is that we don't really know what we are doing.

I don't need to waste my time with a computer just because I am a computer scientist.

Thanks to the greatly improved possibility of communication, we overrate its importance. Even stronger, we underrate the importance of isolation.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Beware of "the real world". A speaker's apeal to it is always an invitation not to challenge his tacit assumptions.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Thank goodness we don't have only serious problems, but ridiculous ones as well.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
It used to be the program's purpose to instruct our computers; it became the computer's purpose to execute our programs.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Probably I am very naive, but I also think I prefer to remain so, at least for the time being and perhaps for the rest of my life.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
In the software business there are many enterprises for which it is not clear that science can help them; that science should try is not clear either.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
There is very little point in trying to urge the world to mend its ways as long as that world is still convinced that its ways are perfectly adequate.

The key to understanding complicated things is knowing what not to look at.
