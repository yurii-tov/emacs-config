Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.

Adapting old programs to fit new machines usually means adapting new machines to behave like old ones.

In man-machine symbiosis, it is man who must adjust: The machines can't.

Time spent in sharpening the axe may well be spared from swinging it.

The effort of using machines to mimic the human mind has always struck me as rather silly. I would rather use them to mimic something better.
-- Edsger Dijkstra

Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.
-- Edsger Dijkstra

Perfecting oneself is as much unlearning as it is learning.

%
Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs.

The key to understanding complicated things is knowing what not to look at.
