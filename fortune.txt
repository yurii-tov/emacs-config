It isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, it's what we know that ain't so.

Begin with the simplest examples.

One must be able to say at all times--instead of points, straight lines, and planes--tables, chairs, and beer mugs üç∫

Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.
-- Alan Perlis
%
Adapting old programs to fit new machines usually means adapting new machines to behave like old ones.
-- Alan Perlis
%
Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for them.
-- Alan Perlis
%
In man-machine symbiosis, it is man who must adjust: The machines can't.
-- Alan Perlis
%
One can't proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.
-- Alan Perlis
%
Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.
-- Alan Perlis
%
It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.
-- Alan Perlis
%
One man's constant is another man's variable.
-- Alan Perlis
%
It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures.

Don‚Äôt document the problem, fix it.
-- Atli Bj√∂rgvin Oddsson
%
Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.
-- Benjamin Franklin
%
Real knowledge is to know the extent of one‚Äôs ignorance.
-- Confucius
%
As a rule, software systems do not work well until they have been used, and have failed repeatedly, in real applications.
-- Dave Parnas
%
Time spent in sharpening the axe may well be spared from swinging it.
%
The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
The effort of using machines to mimic the human mind has always struck me as rather silly. I would rather use them to mimic something better.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Perfecting oneself is as much unlearning as it is learning.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Much of the excitement we get out of our work is that we don't really know what we are doing.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Experience does by no means automatically leads to wisdom and understanding.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
The prisoner falls in love with his chains.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
I don't need to waste my time with a computer just because I am a computer scientist.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Thanks to the greatly improved possibility of communication, we overrate its importance. Even stronger, we underrate the importance of isolation.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Beware of "the real world". A speaker's apeal to it is always an invitation not to challenge his tacit assumptions.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
Thank goodness we don't have only serious problems, but ridiculous ones as well.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
The key to understanding complicated things is knowing what not to look at.
-- Gerald Jay Sussman
%
A recursive definition does not necessarily lead to a recursive process.
-- Gerald Jay Sussman
%
Simplicity, carried to the extreme, becomes elegance.
-- Jon Franklin
%
From a programmer‚Äôs point of view, the user is a peripheral that types when you issue a read request.
-- P. Williams
%
The more you know, the more you realize you know nothing.
-- Socrates

The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.
