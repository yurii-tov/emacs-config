LISP has jokingly been described as "the most intelligent way to misuse a
computer." I think that description is a great compliment because it transmits
the full flavour of liberation: it has assisted a number of our most gifted
fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts.

Probably I am very naive, but I also think I prefer to remain so, at least for
the time being and perhaps for the rest of my life.

In the good old days physicists repeated each other's experiments, just to be
sure. Today they stick to FORTRAN, so that they can share each other's programs,
bugs included.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
We are all shaped by the tools we use, in particular: the formalisms we use
shape our thinking habits, for better or for worse, and that means that we have
to be very careful in the choice of what we learn and teach, for unlearning is
not really possible.

%
The effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction must be regarded as one
of the most vital activities of a competent programmer.

%
I would therefore like to posit that computing's central challenge, how not to
make a mess of it, has not yet been met.

%
Teaching to unsuspecting youngsters the effective use of formal methods is one
of the joys of life because it is so extremely rewarding.

About the use of language: it is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a blunt
axe. It is equally vain to try to do it with ten blunt axes instead.

%
The traditional mathematician recognizes and appreciates mathematical elegance
when he sees it. I propose to go one step further, and to consider elegance an
essential ingredient of mathematics: if it is clumsy, it is not mathematics.

%
If there is one 'scientific' discovery I am proud of, it is the discovery of the
habit of writing without publication in mind.

So-called "natural language" is wonderful for the purposes it was created for,
such as to be rude in, to tell jokes in, to cheat or to make love in (and
Theorists of Literary Criticism can even be content-free in it), but it is
hopelessly inadequate when we have to deal unambiguously with situations of
great intricacy, situations which unavoidably arise in such activities as
legislation, arbitration, mathematics or programming.

APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection. It is the language of the
future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new generation
of coding bums.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
FORTRAN, the infantile disorder, by now nearly 20 years old, is hopelessly
inadequate for whatever computer application you have in mind today: it is now
too clumsy, too risky, and too expensive to use.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
John von Neumann draws attention to what seemed to him a contrast. He remarked
that for simple mechanisms, it is often easier to describe how they work than
what they do, while for more complicated mechanisms, it is usually the other way
around.

Mathematicians are like managers - they want improvement without change.

%
Please don't fall into the trap of believing that I am terribly dogmatical about
the go to statement. I have the uncomfortable feeling that others are making a
religion out of it, as if the conceptual problems of programming could be solved
by a single trick, by a simple form of coding discipline!
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
In this respect a program is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without
writing it. Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process
and measure "programmer productivity" in terms of "number of lines of code
produced". In so doing they book that number on the wrong side of the ledger: we
should always refer to "the number of lines of code spent".
-- Edsger Dijkstra

[Though computer science is a fairly new discipline, it is predominantly based
on the Cartesian world view. As Edsgar W. Dijkstra has pointed out] A scientific
discipline emerges with the - usually rather slow! - discovery of which aspects
can be meaningfully 'studied' in isolation for the sake of their own
consistency.

%
I now have had my foggy crystal ball for quite a long time. Its predictions are
invariably gloomy and usually correct, but I am quite used to that and they
won't keep me from giving you a few suggestions, even if it is merely an
exercise in futility whose only effect is to make you feel guilty.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
In the software business there are many enterprises for which it is not clear
that science can help them; that science should try is not clear either.

%
Many mathematicians derive part of their self-esteem by feeling themselves the
proud heirs of a long tradition of rational thinking; I am afraid they idealize
their cultural ancestors.

%
I think of the company advertising "Thought Processors" or the college
pretending that learning BASIC suffices or at least helps, whereas the teaching
of BASIC should be rated as a criminal offence: it mutilates the mind beyond
recovery.

Write a paper promising salvation, make it a "structured" something or a
"virtual" something, or "abstract," "distributed" or "higher-order" or
"applicative" and you can almost be certain of having started a new cult.

A programming language is a tool that has profound influence on our thinking
habits.

The problems of the real world are primarily those you are left with when you
refuse to apply their effective solutions.

%
A most important, but also most elusive, aspect of any tool is its influence on
the habits of those who train themselves in its use. If the tool is a
programming language this influence is, whether we like it or not, an influence
on our thinking habits.... A programming language is a tool that has profound
influence on our thinking habits.

Why has elegance found so little following? That is the reality of it. Elegance
has the disadvantage, if that's what it is, that hard work is needed to achieve
it and a good education to appreciate it.

... as a slow-witted human being I have a very small head and I had better learn
to live with it and to respect my limitations and give them full credit, rather
than to try to ignore them, for the latter vain effort will be punished by
failure.

Mentally mutilated potential programmers beyond hope of regeneration.

Beauty is our business.

The use of anthropomorphic terminology forces you linguistically to adopt an
operational view. And it makes it practically impossible to argue about programs
independently of their being executed.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
%
We shall do a much better programming job, provided that we approach the task
with a full appreciation of its tremendous difficulty, provided that we stick to
modest and elegant programming languages, provided that we respect the intrinsic
limitations of the human mind and approach the task as Very Humble Programmers.

In their capacity as a tool, computers will be but a ripple on the surface of
our culture. In their capacity as intellectual challenge, they are without
precedent in the cultural history of mankind.

PL/1, the fatal disease, belongs more to the problem set than to the solution
set.

Progress is possible only if we train ourselves to think about programs without
thinking of them as pieces of executable code.

I mentioned the non-competitive spirit explicitly, because these days,
excellence is a fashionable concept. But excellence is a competitive notion, and
that is not what we are heading for: we are heading for perfection.

Computer science has as much to do with computers as astronomy has to do with

There is very little point in trying to urge the world to mend its ways as long

When we take the position that it is not only the programmer's responsibility to
produce a correct program but also to demonstrate its correctness in a
convincing manner, then the above remarks have a profound influence on the
programmer's activity: the object he has to produce must be usefully structured.

There should be no such thing as boring mathematics.

When I came back from Munich, it was September, and I was Professor of
Mathematics at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Later I learned that I
had been the Department's third choice, after two numerical analysts had turned
the invitation down; the decision to invite me had not been an easy one, on the
one hand because I had not really studied mathematics, and on the other hand
because of my sandals, my beard and my "arrogance" (whatever that may be).

Some consider the puzzles that are created by their omissions as spicy
challenges, without which their texts would be boring; others shun clarity lest
their work is considered trivial.

Several people have told me that my inability to suffer fools gladly is one of
my main weaknesses.

A convincing demonstration of correctness being impossible as long as the
mechanism is regarded as a black box, our only hope lies in not regarding the
mechanism as a black box.

In engineering, as in other creative arts, we must learn to do analysis to
support our efforts in synthesis. One cannot build a beautiful and functional
bridge without a knowledge of steel and dirt, and a considerable mathematical
technique for using this knowledge to compute the properties of
structures. Similarly, one cannot build a beautiful computer system without a
deep understanding of how to "previsualize" the process generated by the code
one writes.
-- Gerald Jay Sussman
%
being smart in the arts is the same as being smart in engineering is the same as
being smart in writing is the same as being smart in anything, really. it's the
ability to manipulate all the pieces of the puzzle in your mind, try to fit them
together, and when they don't fit quite right... you sand the edges/corners and
make them all fit.

A recursive definition does not necessarily lead to a recursive process.

The reason why people think of programming as being hard is because you're
writing down a general rule which is going to be used for lots of instances that
a particular instance must process correctly.
