I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun.

В разговоре с людьми здравого рассудка и среднего образования можно
заметить, что в вопросах личного жизненного опыта они отменно толковы,

неправдоподобную чушь.  Домохозяйка никогда не согласится с тем, что
горшок, оставленный в кладовке, может превратиться в голубя, но легко
поверит в то, что звезды влияют на человеческие судьбы

Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren’t doing anything.  One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them.  Very often they’re sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space.  What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.
